Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it\u2019s using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.",

A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute.
